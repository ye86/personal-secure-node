## Purpose of This Document

This document serves as a public, timestamped origin statement for the
Personal Secure Node (PSN) concept.

It exists to clearly record:

- The original intent
- The historical context in which PSN was conceived

This document is not a license, not a manifesto, and not a marketing
statement.

---

## Origin Context

The concept of Personal Secure Node (PSN) originated from the lived
experience of an overseas IT worker confronting restricted communication
environments, opaque digital control systems, and the absence of
individual sovereignty over digital devices and identities.

PSN was conceived as a technical response—not a political statement—to
the following structural problems:

- Communication tools that do not obey the user's will
- Digital identities owned and revoked by platforms
- Devices acting beyond the user's understanding or consent

---

## Core Assertion

A human being must be able to assume responsibility for their own
digital boundary.

If responsibility is unavoidable, authority must be non-transferable.

---

## Non-Goals

PSN is explicitly not designed to:
- Enable anonymity for the purpose of evading law
- Circumvent national regulations
- Operate as a content or social platform

---

## Authorship and Attribution

This document establishes Fang Ye as the original author of the PSN
concept.

Subsequent implementations, discussions, or derivative works may
reference, extend, or critique PSN, but this document records the
initial public articulation of the concept.

---

## Closing Note

PSN does not seek adoption by force or ideology.

Its existence is justified solely by its technical coherence and its
alignment with human responsibility.
